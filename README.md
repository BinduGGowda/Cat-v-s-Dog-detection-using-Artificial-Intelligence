# Cat-v-s-Dog-detection-using-Artificial-Intelligence
By utilizing the deep learning capabilities of Keras and TensorFlow, we have built a robust system that can learn from a large dataset of labeled images. The model undergoes a training phase where it learns to identify patterns and features specific to dogs and cats. This process involves adjusting numerous parameters and weights within the neural network to optimize its performance.

Once the model is trained, we proceed to the testing phase, where we evaluate its accuracy and reliability in classifying unseen images. By inputting new images into the model, it predicts whether the image contains a dog or a cat, providing us with valuable insights into its classification capabilities.

Throughout this repository, we adhere to best practices and follow a systematic approach to ensure the model's reliability and generalization. We provide detailed documentation and instructions to help users understand and replicate the process, allowing them to apply similar techniques to different classification problems.
